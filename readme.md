## Technologies 

Quick overview with code examples of the tech that makes ESC Flights tick. 

### React 

One of the key features of React is that it lets you build your UI as a collection of reuseable components. Also everything is in Javascript so its easy to create conditional logic to control what components are shown based on the state of your app. 

Below is an example of how I handled the conditional logic for loading the flight list.
